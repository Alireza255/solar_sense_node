# 🌞 Solar Sense Node

A **portable solar measuremnet unit** designed to work alongside **IV-curve tracing systems**, providing accurate environmental and panel-related measurements that complement **IV-curve tracing systems**.

This device wirelessly transmits real-time measurement data to a **IV-curve tracer unit**, enabling accurate data interpretation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Accurate IV-curve measurement of solar panels requires precise knowledge of environmental conditions at the time of measurement. This project addresses that need by introducing a **dedicated wireless solar sensor module** that:

* Measures **solar irradiance** directly at the panel location
* Monitors **solar panel temperature**
* Determines **panel tilt angle**
* Sends all collected data wirelessly to the IV-curve measurement device
